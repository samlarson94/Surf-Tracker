## Description
This is a simple app that utilizes OpenWeatherMap's API to show current weather data in a given city.

The current version is built as an MVP with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I'm currently working on a React Native version and a Swift version to make this into a free mobile app.  My end goal is to build a resource that surfers can use to quickly check sun, wind, and tide information from their Apple Watch or mobile device. 

## Usage & Installation
This version of the app currently lives on localhost. In order to use it, you'll need to clone the respository's code to your local machine - please make sure to fork before you do so if you wish to make changes.

After cloning, run an "npm i" command in your terminal to add all dependencies.  Make sure Moment.js has been added by running a "npm moment.js --version" command.  You can then start this app by opening the HTML file in your local browser.

## Future Development
- Build out React and React Native versions. 
- Build out Swift version for iphone and Apple Watch. 
- Implement an Auto-Complete feature when searching to help with UX.
- Add Weather API with more surf-related information (tide times, swell heights, etc).
